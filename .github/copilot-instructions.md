# General

# Code
## Design
This project should demonstrate good code organisation and design.
Please try to keep the code simple, small, and concise. Don't include behaviour beyond what is being discussed. √Ålways produce minimal code.

## Formatting
We use 4 spaces indentation for typescript, but for configuration files, we keep them as they were generated. We do not use semicolons, but as with indentation, we keep them in configuration files.

## Comments
When there are comments in the code, you keep them as they are, unless you need to update them to reflect changes in the code. Do not add comments to describe what changed, or refer to deleted code. Use them judicously, and prefer factoring to smaller functions instead.
